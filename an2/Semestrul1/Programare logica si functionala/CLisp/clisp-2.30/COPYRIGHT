Note:

  This copyright does *not* cover user programs that run in CLISP and
  third-party packages not part of CLISP, if they only reference external
  symbols in CLISP's public packages (namely the packages COMMON-LISP,
  COMMON-LISP-USER, KEYWORD, EXT), i.e. if they don't rely on CLISP
  internals and would as well run in any other Common Lisp implementation.
  Such user programs are not covered by the term "derived work" used in
  the GNU GPL. Neither is their compiled code, i.e. the result of compiling
  them by use of the function COMPILE-FILE. We refer to such user programs
  as "independent work".

  You may copy and distribute memory image files generated by the
  function SAVEINITMEM, if it was generated only from CLISP and independent
  work, and provided that you accompany them, in the sense of section 3
  of the GNU GPL, with the source code of CLISP - precisely the same CLISP
  version that was used to build the memory image -, the source or compiled
  code of the user programs needed to rebuild the memory image (source
  code for all the parts that are not independent work, see above), and
  a precise description how to rebuild the memory image from these.
