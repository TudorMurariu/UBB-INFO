Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
GNU CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible of Karlsruhe
University and Michael Stoll of Munich University, both in Germany.
It mostly supports the Lisp described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard.
It runs on microcomputers (OS/2, Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/ME,
Amiga 500-4000, Acorn RISC PC) as well as on Unix workstations (Linux,
SVR4, Sun4, DEC Alpha OSF, HP-UX, BeOS, NeXTstep, SGI, AIX, Sun3 and
others) and needs only 2 MB of RAM.
It is Free Software and may be distributed under the terms of GNU GPL,
while it is possible to distribute commercial applications compiled
with GNU CLISP.
The user interface comes in German, English, French, Spanish, Dutch
and Russian.
GNU CLISP includes an interpreter, a compiler, a debugger, a large
subset of CLOS, a foreign language interface and a socket interface.
An X11 interface is available through CLX and Garnet.
