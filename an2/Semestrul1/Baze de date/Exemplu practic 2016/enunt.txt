1. You must create a database that manages cinematics from different games. The purpose of the database is to
contain all the information about the cinematics of all games and some details about the heroes that appear in cinematics.
	A) The entities of interest for the problem domani are: Heroes, Cinematics, Games and Companies.
	B) Each game has a name, a release date and belongs to a company. The company has a name, a description and a website.
	C) Each cinematic has a name, an associated game and a list of heroes with an entry moment for each hero.
	The entry moment is represented as an hour/minute/second pair (ex: a hero appears at 00:02:33). Every hero
	has a name, a description and an importance.

1) Write a SQL script to create a relational data model in order to represent the required data. (4 points)

2) Create a store procedure that receives a hero, a cinematic, and an entry moment and adds the new cinematic to
the hero. If the cinematic already exists, the entry moment is updated. (2 points)

3) Create a view that shows the name and the importance of all heroes that appear in all cinematics. (1 point)

4) Create a function that lists the name of the company, the name of the game and the title of the cinematic for all 
games that have the release date greater than or equal to '2000-12-02' and less than or equal to '2016-01-01'. (2 points)
