The file netscience.gml contains a coauthorship network of scientists
working on network theory and experiment, as compiled by M. Newman in May
2006.  The network was compiled from the bibliographies of two review
articles on networks, M. E. J. Newman, SIAM Review 45, 167-256 (2003) and
S. Boccaletti et al., Physics Reports 424, 175-308 (2006), with a few
additional references added by hand.  The version given here contains all
components of the network, for a total of 1589 scientists, and not just the
largest component of 379 scientists previously published.  The network is
weighted, with weights assigned as described in M. E. J. Newman,
Phys. Rev. E 64, 016132 (2001).
